I have used a public dataset to perform the Disease Prediction from Symtoms
I could have gone for some fancy algorithm to solve the given problem but the type of algorithm completely depends upon data. But I choose KNN as the best model to solve the problem.
In the notebook file you can how I did exploratory data analysis of the data, data cleaning and then Data modelling.
In my algorithm I have shown how we create the model and predict the test data with high accuracy. But in case of different levels of disease ascending to descesding we can just sort the distance metric(euclidean distance) of the neighbours and find out the sorted disease.
